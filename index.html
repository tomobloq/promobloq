              It’s very expensive and time consuming for you to find Agency, Integration and Referral partners who will actively promote your digital solutions to their massive, engaged audience without offering deep discounts that attracts unqualified customers or users.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              You have to invest in partner management software, offer 20 – 40% lifetime recurring commissions and still plead with your partners to promote your digital solutions.
