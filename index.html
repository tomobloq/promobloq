              Your digital business generates revenue, but you still can’t afford to pay yourself and your team	a full-time salary to cover your personal living expenses, and keep your business growing.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              You have to take on personal or business debt. Or chase venture capital to finance the next stage of your product development, sales growth and team growth.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              It’s very difficult to find Agency, Integration and Referral partners who will actively promote your digital solution to their massive, engaged audience without offering deep discounts.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              You have to invest in partner management software, offer 20 – 40% lifetime recurring commissions and still plead with your partners to promote your digital solutions.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              You have to waste 6 – 12 months of your time, negotiate terms with your strategic partners, but still end up nowhere. Or you have to commit your sales, marketing, engineering and customer success resources to make your strategic partnerships profitable.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              You have to publish new content every week, build new backlinks and rank new keywords on Amazon and Google to generate traffic that does not convert into users, customers or members.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              It’s very expensive for you to generate 20 – 30 pre-qualified leads per day who turn into users, customers and members through paid advertising, content marketing and conferences.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              And you have to spend hours on Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and other social media sites to get your digital solutions noticed by prospective users, customers or members.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              You have to create new features, new products and new marketing campaigns so that you can drive traffic that gets you new users, customers or members and increase sales growth.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center text-danger mb-4 mt-4">Imagine Instead…</h2>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners ensure your digital business generates even more revenue, so that you can afford to pay yourself and your team a full-time salary that covers all your personal living expenses; and allows you to stash cash in the bank for future business investments.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners finance the next stage of your product development and sales growth, so that you don’t have to take on personal or business debt, and make venture capital chase you.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners get their Agency, Integration and Referral partners to promote your digital solutions to their audience without offering discounts that devalues your digital solutions.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners pay for the partner management software, pays you real money in advance, and then pleads with you to promote their digital solution to your massive audience.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners agree to your terms 95 percent of the time, and follow-through on their commitment without lengthy, back-and-forth negotiations with lawyers that takes 6 – 12 months.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners devote their engineering, marketing, sales and customer success team to making your strategic partnership very profitable from day one, even 10 years from now.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners publish new content, build new backlinks and rank new keywords to generate pre-qualified traffic that converts into new sales, and even repeat sales for you.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners send you 20 – 30 pre-qualified leads per day that turn into paid users, customers and members in record time and shorten your sales cycles, all at no upfront cost.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners do the social selling, outbound marketing and content marketing that gets you and your digital business noticed everywhere and always keeps you top-of-mind.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Your strategic partners create the features, the new products, the new marketing campaigns and test the new traffic channels that will increase your sales growth, reduce your customer acquisition costs, and increase your customer life-time value, in just 12 weeks or less, risk-free.
