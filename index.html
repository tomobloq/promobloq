          <div class="col-lg-10">
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              It’s very expensive and time consuming for you to acquire Agency, Integration and Referral partners who will actively promote your digital business to their massive, engaged audience.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              You have to invest in partner management software, offer 20 – 40% lifetime recurring commissions and still beg with your channel partners to promote your digital business.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              You have to waste 6 – 12 months of your time to negotiate terms with your channel partners, but you still end up nowhere. Or you have to commit your sales, marketing, engineering and customer success resources to make your channel partnerships profitable.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              You have to publish new content every week, build new backlinks and rank new keywords on Amazon and Google to generate traffic that does not convert into new customers, clients and channel partners fast enough to accelerate your sales growth.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              It’s very expensive for you to generate 75 – 100 pre-qualified leads per day who turn into new customers, clients and channel partners through paid ads, content marketing and conferences.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              And you have to spend hours on Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and other social media sites to get your digital business noticed by your future customers, clients and channel partners.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              You have to create new features, new products and new marketing campaigns so that you can drive traffic that gets you new customers, clients and channel partners you desperately need to unlock more sales growth inside your digital business.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center text-danger mb-4 mt-4">Imagine Instead…</h2>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners ensure your digital business generates even more revenue, so that you can you also increase your cash-on-hand or re-invest into your digital business.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners finance the next stage of your product development and sales growth, so that you can also avoid business debt and get an even better valuation.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners get their Agency, Integration and Referral partners to promote your digital business to their best customers, clients and partners without offering deep discounts.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners pay for the partner management software, pays you real money in advance, and then begs you to promote their digital business to your massive audience.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners agree to your terms 95 percent of the time and follow-through on their commitment without lengthy, back-and-forth negotiations that takes 6 – 12 months.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners devote their engineering, marketing, sales and customer success team to making your channel partnership very profitable from day one, even 10 years from now.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners publish new content, build new backlinks and rank new keywords to generate pre-qualified traffic that converts into new sales, and even repeat sales for you.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners send you 75 – 100 pre-qualified leads per day that turn into new customers and clients in record time and shorten your sales cycles, all at no upfront cost.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners do the social selling, outbound marketing and content marketing that gets you and your digital business noticed everywhere and always keeps you top-of-mind.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Your channel partners create the features, the new products, the new marketing campaigns and test the new traffic channels that will increase your sales growth, reduce your customer acquisition costs, and increase your customer life-time value, all in just 12 weeks or less.
            </p>

              Remember, you’ll never find the exact sales growth systems and hyper-growth flywheel you’re about to install inside your digital business offered on performance-base anywhere else. We’ve taken almost all the courses, read almost all the books, attended almost all the workshops…
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              And we even help our clients implement other growth solutions for digital businesses.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              None of them leverages the dormant and underperforming assets you’ve created already to <span class="text-danger font-weight-600">quickly add 6-figures+ in pure, gross profits</span> to your bottom line in just 12 weeks or less.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              So stop shopping around, go ahead and book a <a href="https://meetings.hubspot.com/team167"><u><b>Rapid Consulting Session</b></u></a> and talk to a real human so you can get started today. You can also call or text 347 460 5775.

            <p style="font-size:21px;">
              Please <b><u>DO NOT</u></b> wait and allow another ambitious product developer, marketer or founder to capitalize on this unfair advantage <u><b>INSTEAD of you</b></u> because we only onboard 4 new clients per month for this high-touch, hyper-growth implementation service.
